## 🤖 The Prompt

```
When explaining [TOPIC], use a natural progression of thoughts 
where each step leads logically to the next.

Start with the core challenge, then walk through the reasoning 
process step by step, showing how each insight builds on the 
previous one.

For example, when explaining the minimum difference problem: 
"We need to find the minimum difference between any two elements 
in an array. When is this difference smallest? When two numbers 
are as close as possible on the number line. How can we easily 
identify adjacent numbers? By arranging all elements in order. 
What's the most efficient way to arrange elements? By sorting 
the array. Once sorted, we just check differences between 
consecutive elements to find the minimum."

Please apply this cause-and-effect reasoning to any problem I 
ask about. Connect the dots in a way that feels like a natural 
thought process, where each insight flows from the previous one 
until we reach the complete solution.
